1.	Overview of the analysis: Explain the purpose of the new analysis.
The purpose of the new analysis is to create a data frame summary that shows the relationship between ride date and the city type (rural, urban, and suburban). Once the relationship has been established, we then create a line graph that corresponds to the weekly fares for each city type, we are able to achieve this using function such as  group by  with the count, sum to arrive at the total number of drivers, rides and fares with each city type. This makes it easy in calculating the average fare per ride and driver. This information allows us to be able to format a new data frame and also reformat the columns The second deliverable for the analysis requires that we use a pivot() and also a resample function in creating multiple line graph to show the sum of fares for each week in association for each city type between the months of January through April 2019.


2.	Results: Using images from the summary DataFrame and multiple-line chart, describe the differences in ride-sharing data among the different city types.
 

 

Looking at the DataFrame and the multiple -line chart, urban city had the most amount driver, total rides and highest total fares but on the contrary urban city has the lowest average  rate per fare and per driver. 

3.	Summary: Based on the results, provide three business recommendations to the CEO for addressing any disparities among the city types.
In summary based on results, the  first business recommendation I will suggest in addressing the possibly disparities among the city type are to have drivers assigned to city types based on the city they are more familiar with. Second, to raise the average fare per ride for the urban city, there should be an increase in amount charge per mile. Third, increase in commercializing the driving opportunities for driver in rural cities and suburban cities to drive a surge in drivers and total fare.
